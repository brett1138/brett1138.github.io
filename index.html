                    The dreams that come when we awake<br>
                    Do not our entire picture make.<br>
                    As we pass days idly by,<br>
                    And the world is hurled across our eyes,<br>
                    <br>
                    The streams around us, you and me,<br>
                    Leave much untested and unseen.<br>
                    Although we’d like to see it all,<br>
                    Yet we stumble, yet we fall.<br>
                    <br>
                    Slipping between our fingerprints,<br>
                    The sands of time glitter and glint,<br>
                    But who’s to wonder, and who’s to say<br>
                    What makes us up, from day to day?<br>
                    <br>
                    Together, we in our waking find<br>
                    That dreaming’s caught us by the mind!<br>
                    Marching toward whatever end;<br>
                    Closer or farther, from our friends,<br>
                    Holding fast and making sure<br>
                    We’re somehow defined among the blur.<br>
                    <br>
                    As the lines around us trace<br>
                    (between the creases on our face)<br>
                    We hold together, shining bright,<br>
                    In waking, dreaming, through this night.<br>

                <p>I cannot imagine the lives I have not lived,<br>
                    Their potential shining just past the edge of my mind –<br>
                    <br>
                    The paths I never walked, and the dazzling lights at their end<br>
                    I can just now see my own, the light waiting for me<br>
                    that path I have chosen with its broad spaces mixed with<br>
                    tight turns of bramble-thorn.<br>
                    <br>
                    The ambrosia of youth invades my steady gait, consistency fails.<br>
                    Sadness, regret, pain, youth…<br>
                    <br>
                    Mixed in the uncertainties and disappointments is the pulsing signal:<br>
                    “You are here, we are here – together now we walk, we wait…”<br>
                    <br>
                    The song goes on, though I am woefully out of tune (I never had perfect pitch,<br>
                    and there are registers I can no longer hear), I will persist.<br>
                    <br>
                    Despite the darkness I will share my light,<br>
                    shedding light on the depths and darknesses infringing on the pains<br>
                    the regrets,<br>
                    the sadness,<br>
                    and youth.<br>
                    <br>
                    For the paths we walk, despite free will, are often not<br>
                    wholly of our choosing.<br>
                    <br>
                    Though we choose duty,<br>
                    the shape of that duty<br>
                    its size and scope<br>
                    are beyond us.<br>
                    <br>
                    I choose to step, step, and step again.<br>
                    One foot at a time.<br>
                    <br>
                    I will imagine the future, instead<br>
                    it’s bring light shining toward me now<br>
                    calling, beckoning, drawing,<br>
                    until one day<br>
                    when that recognition<br>
                    becomes cognition<br>
                    <br>
                    and our bleeding together<br>
                    becomes healing, healed, whole.<br>
                    <br>
                    We will breathe the ultimate sigh of relief,<br>
                    which eternities cannot describe<br>
                    of all the worries past and present<br>
                    those tribulations-come-true<br>
                    which rocked us<br>
                    which derailed us<br>
                    which changed the shape of our lives entirely<br>
                    <br>
                    are memory, and their<br>
                    resulting kinetics<br>
                    <br>
                    grow<br>
                    <br>
                    into the cracks they caused.
